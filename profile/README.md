## Hi there 👋
I have created this organization to keep all the information around Terraform safe, like studies, hands-on, articles, tech talks. My idea is share all the tech content related to Terraform and Infrastructure as Code.

## Pull requests
Your patches are welcome. Here's our suggested workflow:
 
- Fork the project.
- Make your feature addition or bug fix.
- Send us a pull request with a description of your work. Bonus points for topic branches!
